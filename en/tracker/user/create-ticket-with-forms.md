# Creating an issue from a form

You can create issues automatically based on information taken from [{{ forms-full-name }}]({{ link-forms }}) by setting up integration with {{ tracker-name }}.

You can use a form to create issues as follows:

- The form is published by a direct link on a website or {{ wiki-full-name }} page.

   In the case of this type of publication, fill out the form and submit it. An issue will be created based on the entered data.

   Using such forms, even users without access to {{ tracker-name }} can create issues on their own. Forms are convenient, for example, when you need to [accept support or service requests from users](../support-process-mail-forms.md).

- The form is [added to a queue in {{ tracker-name }}](../manager/attach-form.md) as a template for quick creation of standard issues.

   In the case of this form publication method, go to the issue page, then click **Create issue**, select the form, and fill out its fields. An issue will be created based on the entered data.

To learn more about integration with {{ forms-full-name }}, see [{#T}](../manager/forms-integration.md).
