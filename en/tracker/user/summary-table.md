# Pivot table

![](../../_assets/tracker/widgets/table.png)

A simple pivot table that enables you to view issue statistics by any pair of parameters. At the table intersections, you can seeÂ the number of issues that match the parameters. You can use this type of table, for instance, to track the quantity and status of issues for a specific group of assignees.

To configure a widget, set the following:

- **Widget name**: Name to display in the widget header.

- **Issue source**: Filter on the basis of which the list of issues is formed. You can select a [system](default-filters.md) filter or a [previously created](create-filter.md) filter from the list or specify a filter using the [query language](query-filter.md) or parameters.

- **Columns**: Parameter to use for table columns.

- **Rows**: Parameter to use for table rows.

- **Number of rows on page**: Maximum number of table rows to display in the widget. If there are more rows than the maximum, you can see them by clicking **Show All** at the bottom of the widget.

- **Sort by**: Sorting order for table rows.

- **Show total**: If this option is enabled, the table includes the total of all rows and columns.
