# List of project issues

On the **Issue list** tab, you can see all the issues [added](create-project.md#add-tickets) to the project. The list shows the structure of your project: you can build your work hierarchy as a tree of sub-issues, range your issues manually, or sort them by field.

To open the list of project issues:

1. In the left-hand panel, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/project.svg)&nbsp;**Projects** or follow the [direct link]({{ link-tracker }}pages/projects) and open the project page.

1. Go to the **Issue list** tab.

1. Set up the issue display:

{% include [issues-table-queue-filter-project](../../_includes/tracker/issues-table-queue-filter-project.md) %}

{% include [issues-table-project](../../_includes/tracker/issues-table-project.md) %}

## Actions with issues {#issue-actions}

To open the issue actions menu in the list of project issues, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) **Actions** at the end of the line with an issue description.

In the menu, you have the following actions available:
* ![](../../_assets/tracker/text-edit/link.svg) **Copy link**.
* ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/move-up.svg) **Move to top of list** (for manual sorting only).

* ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/convert.svg) **Convert to a [milestone](milestones.md) or issue**.
