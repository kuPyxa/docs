To get started with SMS:
1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create an SMS notification channel with a shared sender](#create-common-channel).
1. [Add a test phone number](#add-test-number).
1. [Send a test SMS](#send-test-sms).
1. [Create a notification channel with an individual sender](#create-individual-channel).
1. [Exit the sandbox](#quit-from-sandbox).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

## Create an SMS notification channel with a shared sender {#create-common-channel}

In {{ cns-name }}, messages to end users are sent through [notification channels](./concepts/index.md#channels).

{% include [common-sender-description](../_includes/notifications/common-sender-description.md) %}

To create a channel with a shared sender:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder you want to create a notification channel in.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ cns-name }}**.
  1. Click **Create notification channel**.
  1. In the **SMS messages** tab, select the [producer type](./concepts/sms.md#senders): **Shared sender**. Then click **Create channel**.

{% endlist %}

## Add a test phone number {#add-test-number}

{% include [sandbox-test-numbers](../_includes/notifications/sandbox-test-numbers.md) %}

To add a test phone number:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. Select the notification channel you previously created.
  1. Go to the ![image](../_assets/console-icons/handset-arrow-in.svg) **Test phone numbers** tab.
  1. Click **Add a test phone number**.
  1. In the window that opens, enter a phone number and click **Get code**. An SMS with a confirmation code will be sent to the specified phone number.

      Russian phone numbers in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format are supported, e.g., `+79991112233`.

  1. Enter the code from the SMS and click **Confirm**.

{% endlist %}

## Send a test SMS {#send-test-sms}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. Next to a test phone number you previously added, click ![image](../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select ![image](../_assets/console-icons/comment.svg) **Send message**.
  1. In the window that opens, enter the message text and click **Send**.

{% endlist %}

## Create a notification channel with an individual sender {#create-individual-channel}

After practicing on a channel with a shared sender, you can register an SMS notification channel with an individual sender.

{% include [individual-sender-description](../_includes/notifications/individual-sender-description.md) %}

To create a channel with an individual sender:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder you want to create a notification channel in.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ cns-name }}**.
  1. Click **Create notification channel**.
  1. In the **SMS messages** tab, select the sender type: **Individual sender**.
  1. Specify the sender’s desired name and click **Create**.

{% endlist %}

After that, a ticket to tech support for registration of the sender’s text name will be automatically generated.

{% include [registration-duration-warning](../_includes/notifications/registration-duration-warning.md) %}

When your registration is complete, you will be notified by tech support that you now have access to an individual sender channel.

## Exit the sandbox {#quit-from-sandbox}

{% include [individual-in-sandbox](../_includes/notifications/individual-in-sandbox.md) %}

After practicing on test phone numbers, you can apply to exit the sandbox mode:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. Select the individual sender notification channel you created earlier.
  1. Click **Exit sandbox**.

      With that done, a tech support ticket to exit the sandbox will be automatically generated.

      {% include [sms-quota-increase](../_includes/notifications/sms-quota-increase.md) %}

{% endlist %}

Once your request is approved, you will be able to send SMS messages to any Russian phone numbers in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format, e.g., `+79991112233`.
