# Invalid file format

`ERR.FILE.PARSE_FAILED.INVALID_EXCEL`

This error occurs when attempting to upload an `.xlsx` file with incorrect metadata as a source for a [file](../../operations/connection/create-file.md) connection. For example, you may get this error if the file was obtained as a result of exporting from a database.

To fix it, save the file in a spreadsheet editor such as Microsoft Excel.
